# Task 2 Part 1
# Write a code, which will:
# 1. create a list of random number of dicts (from 2 to 10)
# dict's random numbers of keys should be letter,
# dict's values should be a number (0-100),
# example: [{'a': 5, 'b': 7, 'g': 11}, {'a': 3, 'c': 35, 'g': 42}]

    return {i: my_dict[i] for i in my_keys}  # returning dict with sorted keys


# 'while' loop was selected because of by using 'for' loop may cause loss duplicates of keys f.e. if generated value for
# amount of keys was 26, and we will have duplicates in keys value (2 times 'a' char) - we will have fewer keys in total

# 2. get previously generated list of dicts and create one common dict:
# if dicts have same key, we will take max value, and rename key with dict number with max value
# if key is only in one dict - take it as is,
# example:{'a_1': 5, 'b': 7, 'c': 35, 'g_2': 42}
